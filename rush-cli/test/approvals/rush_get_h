rush get

  Install a package
  This command runs the main script in the package directory.
  
  This is the default command, which means that running 'rush package' is
  the same as running 'rush get package'.

Alias: g

Usage:
  rush get PACKAGE [options]
  rush get --help | -h

Options:
  --help, -h
    Show this help

  --clone, -c
    Clone the repository if it is not found locally.
    This flag will look for a GitHub user with the same name as the
    repository, and attempt to clone their rush-repo repository.

Arguments:
  PACKAGE
    Package name.
    This can either be the package name without the repository name (in
    this case, the default repository will be used) or in the form of
    'repo:package'.

Examples:
  rush ruby
  rush get ruby
  rush get centos:ruby
